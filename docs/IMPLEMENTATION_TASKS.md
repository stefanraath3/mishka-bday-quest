## üìù Implementation Priority Order

1. **Asset Loading System** - Foundation for everything else
2. **Game Start Flow** - Better user onboarding
3. **Audio Integration** - Core experience enhancement
4. **Arrow Key Camera** - Improved navigation
5. **UI Polish** - Professional finish
6. **Testing & Optimization** - Production ready

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Start with creating the `AssetLoader` utility
2. Build the `LoaderScreen` component
3. Implement the game start modal
4. Integrate audio system step by step
5. Replace camera controls with arrow keys

Each phase can be developed and tested independently, allowing for iterative improvement and early user feedback.
